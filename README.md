MSU Data Analytics BootCamp Module 11 Challenge

Code files: climate.ipynb and app_climate.py in the repository directory SurfsUp

This repository contains two main files: a Jupyter Notebook analysis of weather data collected from weather stations and Python code for a Flask app that performs a similar set of weather data collection/analysis.

The Notebook code uses Python/SQLalchemy to connect to an SQLite database, use two CSV files to populate the database tables, and performs a series of data analyses and charting with pandas dataframes. The Flask app creates a set of static and dynamic URL routes that perform similar functions to the Jupyter Notebook, but in a very basic web-based format.

*Code sourcing statement*
-----------------------

I did use a natural language description of the desired code's functions entered into ChatGPT 3.5 to help with code syntax. I did copy pieces of that code in order to be more efficient, but I tailored it to fit all of the desired functions of this paricular project. I did not directly copy and paste any of this code from the internet otherwise (e.g., from StackExchange or any other webpage). I did not seek any assistance or use code written by my peers or instructors for this challenge.

End of code sourcing statement.

 ----------------------

 The repository also contains the input files needed by the code in a directory called 'Resources'.
